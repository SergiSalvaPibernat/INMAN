# this is said to be a dynamic-programming algorithm,
# algorithm feasible thanks to the optimal substructure of the problem:
# a shortest path between two vertices contains the shortest paths in between its intermediate nodes.

# we are applying dynamic programming because, the solution to a problem
# is obtained from the solution to its constituent sub-problems, therefore,
# the solution is obtained in a recursive (iterative in this case) manner,
# solving all sub-problems (bottom-up) until solving the original problem.
# this is what is done implicitly, although what is explained before is exactly
# the description of the dynamic programming method.
